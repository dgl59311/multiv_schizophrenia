We used the software eLORETA. 
All the analysis is the same as presented in another publication: https://github.com/dgl59311/stats_eegfeatures/tree/master/eeg_analysis/source_connectivity
There are two differences: 
1) We calculated another connectivity measure: Instantaneous phase synchronization
1) The gamma band in the study presented in the repository using the LEMON data is defined from 30 - 45 Hz, whereas for the schizophrenia data, 
the gamma band frequencies ranged from 30 to 70 Hz.
